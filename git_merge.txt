git merge [branch] [branch]

git merge --abort
- restore files to state before merge

1. git checkout [branch 1]
2. git merge [branch 2]

OR

git merge [branch 1] [branch 2]

- Once merge is called, you need to manually sift through code, making sure to delete all special git characters while resolving conflicts.
- Once the file's inspected and resolved (manually), save file, close-out, and 'git add .' 'git commit' (or git commit -m "...").
