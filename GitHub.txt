Big plus, top-right-hand side of github to start repository

Usually only use readme upon making repository when there is no other file to keep, that way you can have a starting commit to work with

git remote
- allows you to view all of your repositories on github

git remote add [name of repository] [URL]
- can be named anything you want, and will always point to the repository's URL
- the standard name for one remote is 'origin'

git remote -v 
- v stands for "verbose," which means that git will display more information

git push [remote to push to] [local branch to push]
